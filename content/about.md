I’ve spent the last 20+ years working in software development, and I’ve learned that whether you are in fitness, media, social netowkr or logistics, the secret sauce is always the same: **great people building great products**. My career has taken me from **Abril Digital** to **Twitter** and **Rocket Internet**, allowing me to tackle technical challenges at every level of scale and complexity. Today, I’m applying those lessons as the **CTO at BEAT81**, driving innovation in the Germany's fitness tech scene.

I’ve never been one to stick to a single lane. I’ve operated as a software engineer, a developer advocate and a product manager before moving into executive leadership. This cross-functional background helps me see the big picture, aligning systems architecture with business goals. I’m just as comfortable discussing API design as I am defining a roadmap for a Series B expansion.

At my core, **I’m a builder and a mentor**. I’m passionate about taking teams from "early-stage chaos" to high-performance engines, ensuring we deliver significant growth without losing our soul. I love the challenge of scaling operations and products, but I get the most satisfaction out of seeing the **teams succeed and shipping software that makes a tangible difference in users' lives**.
