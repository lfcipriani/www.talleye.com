From 2009 to 2013 I worked as software engineer, lead software architect at Abril in the team that built this platform, we were a team of approximately 40 software engineers.

Abril Mídia is one of the largest media companies in Brazil. In 2011 it published 52 titles and is a leader in 22 out of 26 segments in which it operates. In the digital world, the big challenge Abril faces is deliver a large volume of information that it generates in a high diversity of digital channels, such as websites, mobile sites and TVs. The chosen solution was the building of a distributed platform, named Alexandria, that allows the content to be added and handled by separated information domains, implemented with REST constraints and with a hypermedia API, that is exposed to publishers and end users.

The result of this work became a paper published by Springer in the book "[Rest: Advanced Research Topics and Practical Applications](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-9299-3_10 'go to Sringer website')" and it was written by [Luiz Rocha](https://twitter.com/lsdr) and me.

I spoke in QCon Conference São Paulo in 2012 about all the technical aspects of Alexandria, you can find links to [slides (in Portuguese)](https://www.slideshare.net/lfcipriani/como-um-verdadeiro-sistema-rest-funciona-arquitetura-e-performance-na-abril) and the [talk video](https://www.infoq.com/br/presentations/rest-arquitetura-abril) (in Portuguese).
