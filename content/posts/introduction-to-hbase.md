One of the services we had in the [Alexandria Platform](/posts/alexandria-platform) at Abril was the Social Core. Its domain covered any social functionality that a web property in the company could have, such as user timelines, user graphs and follow actions.

Given the large audience of the websites at Abril, we evaluated and adopted HBase as the storage for the user timelines. We later shared our experiences in some tech events in SÃ£o Paulo.
