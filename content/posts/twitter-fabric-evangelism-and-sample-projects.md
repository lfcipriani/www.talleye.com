From 2013 to 2015 I worked at Twitter as a developer advocate in the International developer relations team, presenting Twitter platforms to developers in Latin America and the rest of the world. One of these platforms was Fabric, a mobile platform with several solutions to speed up mobile development and that was later acquired by Google and merged with Firebase.

Beyond [doing talks](https://www.infoq.com/br/presentations/fabric-na-pratica/) in several events, I also built some sample projects that were used as canonical examples of the platform or simply to show off the platform capabilities.

## Live Event Android App

A sample Android Live Event app using Fabric to help your participants to follow what's happening around an event at Twitter.

## Cannonball Android App

In October 2014 Twitter launched [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/ 'visit the website'), a platform for mobile developers that provides several tools to improve their mobile apps. To showcase the tools this platform provided we built Cannonball demo app, a word game similar to magnetic poetry, in which the user can create poems, share with friends, see the popular ones all using the platform features such as: digits, social login, twitter kit, mopub, crashlytics and answers.
