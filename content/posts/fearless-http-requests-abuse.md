This talk was a result of all the research done when building [Alexandria Platform](/posts/alexandria-platform) at Abril. Every web developer probably had used cache one day in their web apps or APIs to avoid redundant data traffic, network bottlenecks, protect your server from load spikes or simply long network latencies.

The slides below were done basically after reading Caching RFC, so if you want a visual reference of web caching, here it goes:

Later in 2013 I presented another talk at Rubyconf Brazil giving more context about caching strategies, you can find [the article in this website as well](/posts/the-4-basic-flows-of-http-caching).
